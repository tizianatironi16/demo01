## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine (version 16.0 or higher recommended).

### Installation

The dependencies are already installed, but if you need to reinstall them:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```
